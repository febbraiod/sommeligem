TopWinesGem or SomGem


It scrapes the Wine.com site for the info needed to perform the following:

It displays all the different wines on the list in order from 1 - 100.

It isolates the name from the grape.
                
choosing a wine will provide a description(might have to just provide a link as the description for each wine is on it's own page) where grown and price.

Alternatively the user can choose the pairing option where they can pare down the list by a food group.  Say if they choose "red meat" or "Beef" The list will redisplay with the wines that match the varietal I associate it with.
